# Archive

This folder contains old versions, unused assets, and setup notes from earlier stages of development. These files are not part of the active bot deployment or demo logic, but are kept for reference.

## Contents
- `admin_panel.py`: Early admin interface prototype
- `tasker_webhook_instruction.txt`: Setup notes for webhook testing
- `generated-icon.png`: Unused asset
- `uv.lock`: Dependency lock file (not used in current setup)

Feel free to revisit or clean up this folder later. Nothing here is required for deployment or testing.
